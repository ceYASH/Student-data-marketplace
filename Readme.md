# Student Marketplace Smart Contract

## Vision

The Student Marketplace aims to create a decentralized platform where students can securely share, sell, and purchase academic resources and data. By leveraging blockchain technology, we envision a transparent and efficient ecosystem that empowers students to monetize their skills and knowledge while providing access to valuable educational resources.

## Features

1. **Student Data Representation**: 
   - The smart contract defines a `StudentData` struct that securely stores student data, including ownership, price, and the actual data.

2. **Data Creation**: 
   - Students can create and store their data on the blockchain using the `create_data` function. This ensures that the ownership of data is clearly defined and verifiable.

3. **Data Purchase Mechanism**: 
   - The `purchase_data` function allows buyers to securely purchase data from sellers. The contract verifies that the buyer has sufficient funds and facilitates the transfer of ownership and payment in a single transaction.

4. **Secure Transactions**: 
   - All transactions are conducted using Aptos Coin, ensuring that payments are secure and transparent.

5. **Ownership Transfer**: 
   - Upon successful purchase, the ownership of the data is transferred to the buyer, updating the state of the smart contract accordingly.

## Future Scope

1. **Expanding Data Types**: 
   - Future versions of the contract could support various types of academic resources, such as video lectures, e-books, and practice exams.

2. **Review and Rating System**: 
   - Implementing a review and rating system for both buyers and sellers to enhance trust and improve the quality of resources available.

3. **Incentive Mechanisms**: 
   - Introducing rewards for students who contribute high-quality resources or for buyers who frequently engage with the platform.

4. **Interoperability with Other Platforms**: 
   - Exploring partnerships and integrations with existing educational platforms to broaden the reach and usability of the marketplace.

5. **User Interface Development**: 
   - Creating a user-friendly front-end application to facilitate easy interaction with the smart contract for both students and potential buyers.

By fostering a decentralized environment for academic resource exchange, the Student Marketplace aims to enhance educational accessibility and empower students in their learning journeys.
